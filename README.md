Add 802.1x and build mop

This is a very rough draft, only posting it cause someone online has said they need something like it.

You point this at a switch by putting the switch's IP in the IPs.txt file.  It then SSHs over and figures out what the config is that needs to be added to the config.  It doesn't do well with multiple access vlans sadly.
